# CloudFormation Networking Template

## Overview
This repository contains an AWS CloudFormation template for setting up basic networking infrastructure in an AWS environment. The template automates the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), public subnets, internet gateway, route tables, network ACLs, and an EC2 instance acting as a bastion host.

## Features
- **Scalable Networking**: Easily deploy scalable networking infrastructure on AWS with predefined configurations.
- **High Availability**: Utilizes multiple availability zones for increased fault tolerance and availability.
- **Security**: Implements network ACLs and security groups to control traffic flow and enhance security.
- **Automation**: Leverages CloudFormation for automated provisioning and management of AWS resources.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the CloudFormation template (`networking-template.yaml`) to customize parameters such as instance type, subnet configurations, etc., according to your requirements.
3. Deploy the template using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or any other preferred method.
4. Once deployed, you'll have a fully functional networking setup on AWS ready for use.
